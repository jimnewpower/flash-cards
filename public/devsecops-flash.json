        "question": "What is IAM?",
        "answer": "Identity and Access Management (IAM) is a security framework that helps organizations manage and secure digital identities. IAM systems control who has access to what resources, and when. They also help to ensure that only authorized users can access sensitive data."

        "question": "What is SIEM?",
        "answer": "SIEM stands for Security Information and Event Management. It is a security solution that helps organizations collect, analyze, and correlate security logs from a variety of sources, such as firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and servers. SIEM solutions can help organizations identify security threats, investigate security incidents, and comply with security regulations.",

        "question": "What is CASB?",
        "answer": "A cloud access security broker (CASB) is a security policy enforcement point that is placed between cloud service consumers and cloud service providers to combine and interject enterprise security policies as the cloud-based resources are accessed."

        "question": "What is EDR?",
        "answer": "Endpoint detection and response (EDR) is a security solution that monitors and analyzes endpoint devices, such as laptops and desktops, for suspicious activity. EDR solutions can help organizations to detect and respond to security threats, such as malware, ransomware, and data breaches."

        "question": "What is Authentication?",
        "answer": "The process of verifying the identity of a user or process."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is agent-based authentication?",
        "answer": "Requires the use of a software agent on the user's device. More secure, but also more complex to implement and manage than agentless authentication."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is agentless authentication?",
        "answer": "User's credentials are verified by the authentication server directly (e.g. via a REST API). Easier to implement and manage than agent-based authentication, but less secure."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is identity security?",
        "answer": "A set of principles, processes, and technologies that are used to ensure the security of digital identities. It encompasses the management of user identities, access rights, and privileges."

        "question": "What is DevSecOps?",
        "answer": "DevOps + Security: build security into the software development lifecycle."
