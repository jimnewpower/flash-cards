It allows these websites and applications to share data with other websites and applications without compromising the security of the user's account. OAuth works by using a series of tokens. A client application requests access to a resource from the resource owner. The resource owner authorizes the client application to access the resource, and the resource owner's authorization server issues a token to the client application. The client application then uses the token to access the resource. OAuth is a secure and flexible way to authorize access to resources.
